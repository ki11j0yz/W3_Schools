# the range() function allows looping through code a specified number of times
# returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number
for x in range(10):
    print(x)
# note that range(10), the sequence stops at 9, not 10 - if you were to change to range(11) - you would print out 10.
